objdump -Slx svchost.exe > svc.S

You can install Cygwin and use objdump to decompile an exe into asm. Be sure you select the binutils when installing cygwin. 
After installing cygwin, you can run the following from a bash shell:

objdump -Slx yourpgm.exe

Try ghidra for looking at the assembly dump by objdump or directly .exe file
