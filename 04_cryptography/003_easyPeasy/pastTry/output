otp.py is just copy of implementation of otp.py on server
pip3 install pwn
need my input to be len(input) - 32(for keylocation) = 50000-32

so basically while running on the server we can manipulate the key_location to out advantage.
> first send input(with 50000-32 bytes) of data : this will move the key to (50000%(len(input)+32))==0

> then just send the a's or b's any thing [ 32 bytes ]

> now while running the script the key_location is 0. 
    and the encodedFlag that we get(64bit) is encrypted with this specific keylocation=0
    and now we are at that stage manually and 
    we do no know the key but we know 2 values whose xor is the key as
        - [text send as input] ^ [key] = [ result we will get while running on server when keyLoc = 0]
        - [encoded_flag ] ^ ([textsend] ^ [result got]) = what we need in 64 bits
